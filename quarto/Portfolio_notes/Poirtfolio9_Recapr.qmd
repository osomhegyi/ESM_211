What does this package do?
- It is a two event mark-recapture experiment. Catch fish, mark them, then try to catch some of those fish again. Can use it all the time for different species. 2-event becuase with this, we assume a closed population. Three main estimators are Peterson, Chapman, and Bailey. Chapman is great for small sample sizes. If you get a lot of things marked, use Peterson.
- How do we mark individuals, so that we can easily find if they were marked later?

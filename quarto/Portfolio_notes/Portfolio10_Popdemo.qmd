Popdemo - Presented by Steven
- Can project populations in two ways: deterministically and stochastically
- deterministic omits stochasity, super simple and not the most useful, so probably use stochastic projections
- Classify the matrix by either age-structured, or stage-structured
- Can directly adjust the probability matrix
- To list a species under the endangered species act, need to do some sort of future species projection, so these species are often the most well-understood, beucase you need to know what is happenning to the population and why.
- A lot of time when we want to use these models, it is really hard to find the data to work with these models.
- If you get asked to do a Population Viability Analysis (PVA), most likely you will need to use matrix models to do so.

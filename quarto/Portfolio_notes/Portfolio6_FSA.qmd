What does it do? A variety of fish stock stuff. Incorporates many simple tasks
- Fisheries managers want to assess the health of a fish population and its environmnet for management
- Uses weight to length data to calculate habitat quality (i think)
- Fish < 8cm can't be used in the calculation

Catch curve overview
- Linear Regression Basis
- Data needed to put into catch curve: Data and Catch (need to be numeric)

Depletion Model Overview
- It estimates the total population size for a closed population
- Many different methods --> Leslie Method
- DeLury Method: Use this method when the fraction of the stock removed by unit of fishing effort is really small (< 2%)
- K-Pass Method: Just need data on the number that are captured

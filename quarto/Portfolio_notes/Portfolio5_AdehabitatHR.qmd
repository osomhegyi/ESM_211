# Adehabitat
- Great for home ranges
- This package can be used for Connectivity & Fragmentation, Conservation Planning (Identifying priority areas), Disease Ecology, Informing Management Decisions

# Model overview
- Minimum convex polygons - polygons are calculated based on the area that the observed individuals have travelled in
- Kernel Density Estimation: to predict use across space

# What type of data is needed?
- Telemetry data - collected via radio collars, satellite transmitting tags, VHF
- To get this package to work, need to define a spatial points data frame. And then once you have that, you should be able to calculate the areas pretty easily.
- multiple ways to define your kernals
